    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any language, coding in a Python is best learned by doing. Now that you have learned the basics of Python as a programming language, it's time to put your skills to the test by writing code to solve problems based just on their definitioons. In this notebook, you will be presented with a series of coding challenges known as \"katas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"kata\" comes from martial arts, where it refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. The purpose of a code kata is to provide a challenge that you can work on to improve your skills, and improve your algorithmic thinking. Unlike some of the previous exercises in these lectures, these katas will not have step-by-step instructions. Instead, you will need to use your creativity and problem-solving skills to complete them, although helpful hints are provided along the way if you get stuck.\n",

    "### Checking for palindromes\n",
    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, \"madam\" is a palindrome, while \"sir\" is not. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive, so that a string like \"Madam\" is still considered a palindrome, and it should ignore spaces, so that the phrase \"nurses run\" is also considered a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've provided a function signature (using type hint annotations) for you to fill in. You can use the example test cases given in the docstring to help guide your implementation.\n"

We call numbers where the sum of the proper divisors is less than the number itself \"deficient\". For example, all prime numbers are deficent, since their only factor is 1. Numbers where the sum of the proper divisors is greater than the number itself a*re called \"abundant\". The first abundant number is 12, because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12.\n",

    "1. You can use the modulo operator `%` to check if one number is a divisor of another.\n",
    "2. You can use the `range(a, b)` function to generate a sequence of numbers to test as divisors. You only actually need to test numbers up to the square root of the input number, because any divisors larger than that will have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root. Each time you find a divisor, you can also add its pair to the list of divisors (just check not to add the number itself, or to double count if you're testing a square number).\n",
    "3. Python has an inbuilt `sum()` function that you can use to sum the elements of a list, but it can be faster to keep a running total in a variable.\n",
    "4. Simple implementations can be slow when testing large numbers. Can you think of any ways to spped up your algorithm? Think about when we first know that the sum of factors will be greater than the number itself.\n",
